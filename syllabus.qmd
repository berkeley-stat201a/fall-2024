- *An intermediate course in probability, 2nd edition* by Allan Gut
- *Stochastic Processes: Theory for Applications* by Robert G. Gallager

### Prerequisites

- Undergraduate probability (at the level of Berkeley’s Statistics 134)
- Multivariable calculus (at the level of Berkeley’s Mathematics 53) 
- Linear algebra (at the level of Berkeley’s Mathematics 54)
